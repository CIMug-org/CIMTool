        <div id="main">
          <div id="content"><h2>Release 1.5.3 </h2><ul><li><p>enhancement: html profile documentation changed to more closely
follow the part 301 format.  inherited members are shown for each
class, grouped by superclass.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.5.2 </h2><ul><li><p>enhancement: accept comments encoded in as 'description' tags 
from some XMI documents generated by EA</p></li><li><p>correction: the outline and add/remove display was not updating following the 
assignment of a type to an element (ie a profile property).</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.5.1 </h2><ul><li><p>enhancement: updated CIMTool help</p></li><li><p>correction: the remap profile to schema function failed for some profiles</p></li><li><p>package with eclipse 3.4 platform for windows (no JDT hence lighter download)</p></li></ul><h2>Development Releases 1.4.* </h2><p>Caveat: Releases 1.4.* are development releases.  They contain internal changes in 
preparation for the a new guided profile update feature. While they pass the CIMTool 
test suite and unstructured testing, there could nevertheless be regressions. </p><p>The 1.4.* releases can be only obtained from an eclipse update site at:
<a href="http://files.cimtool.org/development" class="external">http://files.cimtool.org/development</a> </p><p>Stable releases are preferred and these are available in a number of forms 
detailed here: <a href="http://wiki.cimtool.org/Download.html" class="internal">http://wiki.cimtool.org/Download.html</a></p><h2>Development Release 1.4.4 </h2><ul><li><p>new feature: CIMTool can now generate a database schema from a CIM profile. 
This is done by selecting the &quot;SQL&quot; option in the profile editor. An SQL92
DDL artifact is generated. This has been tested for compatibility with 
Oracle 10g.</p><p>The generated code includes tables and fields for classes and properties
and comments are copied through for clarity. Constraint definitions 
are generated for mandatory/optional cardinality, enumeration membership, 
association type and class inheritance.</p><p>Class inheritance has been implemented using the PK-PK join approach.</p></li><li><p>correction: the comparison functions were not configured correctly in the
previous release and would yield no results.</p></li><li><p>correction: a regression causing the cardinality of some associations 
extracted from xmi to be incorrect.</p></li><li><p>correction: a regression in the &quot;make leaf classes concrete&quot; function caused
all classes to be marked as not concrete.</p></li><li><p>correction: an infinite loop when generating artifacts from some profiles
containing a circular association.</p></li><li><p>correction: the eclipse platform sometimes reported errors when a profile
was deleted.</p></li></ul><h2>Development Release 1.4.3 </h2><ul><li><p>enhancement: comparisons of profiles to profiles or schema to schema are now much faster and 
require much less memory.  These operations now use CIMTool's cache for the inputs. </p></li><li><p>enhancement: Repair and remap profile function now corrects the namespace of 
enumeration values</p></li><li><p>enhancement: enumerations can now be added directly to the profile 
(previsously they were added only as a side effect of property definition)</p></li><li><p>correction: a regression prevented restriction of the range of a property to a subclass.</p></li><li><p>correction: enumeration restrictions were not carried into the generated OWL and RDFS
artifacts and were not validated in instance documents.</p></li></ul><h2>Development Release 1.4.2 </h2><ul><li><p>new feature: profile consistency checking and problem display. CIMTool will
check each profile against the project schema during the build phase.  
Inconsistencies are recorded in a diagnostic file which can be viewed with
CIMTool's diagnostic editor (also used for instance validation).</p><p>When consistency errors exist error markers appear on the profile resource
(in the Project Explorer view) and the affected profile elements in the
profile outline view.   A entry is also added to the eclipse problems
view. </p><p>This is a first release of this feature and only the most common 
inconsistencies are detected. Some further improvements in the 
checking algorithm and the user interface may be expected.</p><p>Note: to check profiles a project build must be triggered.  A trigger is
generated if the schema (CIM and extensions) or a profile is updated.  </p></li><li><p>new feature: support for the &lt;&lt;extendedBy&gt; and &lt;&lt;extension&gt;&gt; stereotypes 
defined by EDF Research. These stereotypes are used to define CIM extensions.   
CIMTool displays extensions marked with these stereotypes using distinctive 
icons and. In profile editing, extension class members can be added directly 
to the profile of the extended CIM class.</p></li><li><p>enhancement: support for the Siemens PowerCC namespace tags.  These tags
associate a namespace prefix such as 'ext' with each individual class,
association or attribute.   To use this information you must declare
each prefix in the annotation file with a statement like this:  </p><p>&lt;http://www.ercot.com/CIM11R0/2008/2.0/extension#&gt; uml:uriHasPrefix &quot;etx&quot; .</p></li><li><p>enhancements to support some older versions of CIM and EDF models: </p><ul><li><p>do not accept top level datatype definitions in an XMI file as written.
Flexibly assign a type to these identifiers based on related definitions
found elsewhere in the model.</p></li><li><p>accept 'units' as well as 'unit' for the units attribute of a datatype</p></li></ul></li><li><p>correction: the baseuri tag was not recognised in some XMI files.</p></li><li><p>corrections: various regressions introduced in the 1.4.1 development release.</p></li></ul><h2>Development Release 1.4.1 </h2><ul><li><p>First release with internal changes to the ontology API needed for future
features.</p></li><li><p>new feature: Schema comparison using the eclipse compare functionality.
Each project has at least one schema file (generally a .xmi file) in the Schema folder.
To compare two schemas, select them in the Navigator, right click and
choose Compare With &gt; Each Other.  To compare a schema with a recent
version select it, right click and choose Compare With &gt; Local History.</p></li><li><p>new feature: Integrated help.  To access CIMTool help and documentation within
eclipse, choose Help &gt; Help Contents from the main menu.  Look for the topic
&quot;Common CIMTool Tasks&quot; in the table of contents. In the release, the included
help consists of the most useful material from the <a href="" class="contents"></a> web site.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.3.3 </h2><ul><li><p>new feature: &quot;Add package name to default schema namespaces&quot; preference causes 
unique RDF namespaces to be generated from the UML package hierarchy.</p></li><li><p>new feature: CIM/XML profiles can now have more than one restriction, in different
contexts, on the same property. This was previously only supported for XSD profiles.</p><p>The simple-owl format now preserves all property restrictions and the validation 
rules have been reworked to enforce them. </p><p>The standard CIM/XML RDFS format cannot support this and CIMTool rolls up the 
restrictions into a single, consistent property definition. </p></li><li><p>correction: when rolling up restrictions to base classes for RDFS, they are 
always relaxed. this prevents restrictions from incorrectly affecting sibling
classes.  </p></li><li><p>correction: use the concrete stereotype in validation instead of 
treating the leaf classes as concrete.  The &quot;Stereotype leaf classes
as concrete&quot; operation can be used to obtain the previous behaviour. </p></li><li><p>enhancement: stereotypes assigned in the profile editor are copied into the
generated RDFS and simple-OWL.</p></li><li><p>enhancement: build target flags and stereotypes defined in a profile are 
preserved in the &quot;Reorganize per RDFS Rules&quot; operation.</p></li><li><p>enhancement: the property sheet view for diagnostic nodes has been improved.</p></li><li><p>enhancement: tested with eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) </p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.3.2 </h2><ul><li><p>correction: allow unnamed schema properties to be profiled</p></li><li><p>new feature: sawsdl semantic annotations in generated XML Schema 
see: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/sawsdl/" class="external">http://www.w3.org/TR/sawsdl/</a></p></li><li><p>enhancement: generated HTML profile documentation reworked with 
better ordering and formating of information. </p></li><li><p>enhancement: package names added to properties sheet
and generated profile documentation. </p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.3.1 </h2><ul><li><p>new feature: Property sheet view shows details of the selected 
profile or schema definition. This view has been added to the
CIMTool perspective.  From the menu choose Window &gt; Reset Perspective 
to update your perspective. The property sheet replaces some of the
fields on the profile editor detail page.</p></li><li><p>new feature: Profile comparisons using the eclipse compare functionality.
To compare two profiles, select them in the Navigator, right click and
choose Compare With &gt; Each Other.  To compare a profile with a recent
version select it, right click and choose Compare With &gt; Local History.</p></li><li><p>enhancement: preserve association documentation from EA UML 1.4 
(Rose compatible) XMI export files. It is now possible to use 
EA models with CIMTool using those XMI export settings.</p></li><li><p>new feature: simple-owl-augmented and legacy-rdfs-augmented targets
can be built from a profile.  The new targets provide both a 
forward and inverse property for each property defined in the profile.  
They replace the old nested-simple-owl and nested-legacy-rdfs build targets.  
Build new build targets can be selected on the profile editor summary page.   </p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.2.5 </h2><ul><li><p>new feature: add a class hierarchy page to the profile editor</p></li><li><p>new feature: allow more than one named profile per information model class</p></li><li><p>correction to search feature: failed to display matches in some cases</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.2.4 </h2><ul><li><p>change schema tree icons to reflect UML aggregation and composition</p></li><li><p>the 'make leaf classes concrete' option in the profile editor now does exactly that and ignores other</p></li><li><p>capture aggregation annotations from Unisys XMI input</p></li><li><p>support for non-standard primitive to XSD part II mappings</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.2.3 </h2><ul><li><p>Fix regression: ProjectModelView not responding to selection or double click</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.2.2 </h2><ul><li><p>Fix a jena ConversionException when remapping profile to new CIM namespace.</p></li><li><p>Add missing wizard for new incremental validation rules.</p></li><li><p>Correct title in import schema wizard.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.2.1 </h2><ul><li><p>Released under <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/au.com.langdale.cimtoole.help/html/LGPL.html" class="internal">LGPL</a>.</p></li><li><p>Remove a Java 6 dependency.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.1.7 </h2><ul><li><p>Added AbsoluteDateTime to the built-in list of fundamental types. It is 
mapped to an xsd:datetime</p></li><li><p>Fixed a regression that prevented the Import Incremental Model wizard from 
being completed.</p></li><li><p>Fixed a regression in the Validation View in the Validation Perspective. The 
view action buttons were missing.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.1.6 </h2><ul><li><p>Fixed a bug in the backwards compatibility code for the 1.1.5 profile format 
change. The symptom was a failure to generate XML schemas from profile 
created in earlier versions.</p></li><li><p>A bug in the handling of the unit attribute of datatype definitions has been 
corrected.Unit and multiplier values should now be captured in the 
whole-of-schema OWL output as annotation properties. (Although there don't 
seem to be many multiplier values defined in the CIM so far.) To see this 
output choose File|Export|CIMTool|Export Merged Schema from the menus. </p></li><li><p>The schema search wizard has been added to the profile editor.Look for a 
search button on the top right of the Add/Remove page. Classes can found by 
typing in a few characters of their name or the name of one of their 
properties and selecting the desired match. </p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.1.5 </h2><ul><li><p>The form of the generated XML schema has been changed in the case where a 
property is defined with more than one range type. In this case no element 
is generated for the property and an xsd:choice of element representing the 
types appears.</p></li><li><p>A new stereotype &quot;Preserve&quot; has been defined. When assigned to a property 
it causes the property element to be generated wrapping the type elements. 
This can be used to avoid ambiguities that the above schema generation rule 
might cause.</p></li><li><p>A schema search wizard has been added for testing. It is accessed from the 
project model view toolbar.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.1.4 </h2><ul><li><p>Numerical cardinality values other than 0, 1 and unbounded are now 
supported.</p></li><li><p>The Add/Remove tab now has fields for entering the min and max 
cardinality of a property as well as check boxes for the common options. As 
before, cardinality values that would exceed those defined in the CIM for the 
given property are not allowed.</p></li><li><p>Cardinality values are carried through the generated XML schema. In the 
generated RDFS or simple-owl any cardinality greater than one is treated as 
unbounded because those formats do not allow for arbitrary values.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.1.3 </h2><ul><li><p>Completed performance enhancements, improving the display refresh behavior 
in the profile editor.</p></li></ul><h2>Release 1.1.2 </h2><ul><li><p>Numerous regressions that crept into 1.1.1 have been corrected.</p></li><li><p>Performance of the profile editor has been improved. There may be some 
minor display refresh problems introduced by this work, but the editor is 
much more pleasant to use.</p></li><li><p>A merged schema export wizard has been added. This allows you to export OWL 
for the schema (as opposed to a profile) to a file in the workspace, which 
will then be maintained up-to-date- by the build system, or to a file in the 
filesystem. Only the direct rdfs:subClassOf axioms are included, as 
requested.</p></li><li><p>Enumerated values in generated XSD have simple names (with no class prefix).</p></li><li><p>When a range is added to a profile property it is no longer shown with 
label &quot;Unamed&quot;. It is named after the schema class. (Range profiles are new 
feature that allow the range defined in the schema to be narrowed to a union 
of its subclasses.)</p></li><li><p>A stereotype page has been added to the profile editor. Stereotypes can be 
added and removed from profile classes and properties. These are transmitted 
to the generated profile artifacts and can be used in custom profile 
generation rules. The list of available stereotypes is drawn from the UML 
and from a stereotype definition file and from a built-in list.</p></li><li><p>The By Reference and Concrete flags are now represented as stereotypes and 
can be assigned on the stereotype page. By Reference flags in old profiles 
are automatically converted to stereotypes upon editing.</p></li><li><p>The concrete flag was formerly computed and is now a manually assigned 
stereotype. However, the concrete stereotype can be compute for all classes 
in the profile by the new &quot;Repair and Reorganise&quot; wizard.</p></li><li><p>A &quot;Repair and Reorganise&quot; wizard is available from the Summary page of the 
profile editor. This provides a check list of global profile 
transformations and will apply the selected ones in the appropriate order.</p></li></ul><p>The order is:</p><ul><li><p>Stereotype all properties as By Reference</p></li><li><p>Stereotype leaf classes as Concrete</p></li><li><p>Repair and remap profile to schema</p></li><li><p>Reorganise profile per RDFS rules</p></li></ul><p>The remap operation is usefull if namespaces in the schema have been changed. 
It updates the profile to reference a new schema finding the best match for 
each class and property. It performs a number of other repairs as well.</p><p>The reorganise operation we present before. Warning: RDFS rules are 
incompatible with the new property range profiles and these will be lost if 
this operation is performed.</p><h2>Changes 2008-02-15 </h2><ul><li><p>CIM/XML validator passes the full test suite, available at 
<a href="http://files.cimtool.org/Validation-Cases-2008-02-15.zip" class="external">http://files.cimtool.org/Validation-Cases-2008-02-15.zip</a></p></li><li><p>Includes incremental CIM/XML validation.  </p></li><li><p>User interface improvements.</p></li></ul><h2>Changes 2008-01-31 </h2><ul><li><p>CIMTool has expanded namespace support described here:
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/au.com.langdale.cimtoole.help/html/CIMToolNamespaceSupport.html" class="internal">PLUGINS_ROOT/au.com.langdale.cimtoole.help/html/CIMToolNamespaceSupport.html</a></p><ul><li><p>There is support for multiple extension model namespaces.</p></li><li><p>Optionally, those namespaces can be carried through to 
profile artifacts (legacy-rdfs and simple-owl).  This corresponds
to the current practice on the ERCOT project. </p></li><li><p>The pros and cons of the latter practice are discussed here: 
<a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/au.com.langdale.cimtoole.help/html/Namespaces.html" class="internal">PLUGINS_ROOT/au.com.langdale.cimtoole.help/html/Namespaces.html</a></p></li><li><p>For a discussion of CIM extension model techniques using CIMTool
see the UISOL Distributech presentation.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>The CIM/XML validation function has been further developed.</p><ul><li><p>Basic topology validation tests are now included
and the profile conformance tests have been expanded.  </p></li><li><p>Memory footprint is down and speed is up.  
It is now possible to validate giant models such 
ERCOT in about the same time again it takes to parse their XML. 
That is about 5 minutes parse plus 5 minutes validation on my box. 
The models used for IOP testing only take seconds.        </p></li><li><p>A simplified user interface for validating models has been
added.  It is implemented as an eclipse 'perspective' with 
fixed layout and new views, actions and wizards for streamlining 
this task. From the menu select Window &gt; Show Perspective &gt; Validation.</p></li><li><p>A validation result browser has been implemented. This groups
messages by class and property and is linked to the Project Model
View.</p></li><li><p>Repetitive validation messages involving with the same description
and the same class or property are now suppressed by
default.  This behaviour is controlled by a preference.
Check Window &gt; Preferences &gt; CIMTool &gt; Limit validation output.</p></li><li><p>The validation rule language has been improved and simplified.
It is still rather technical to write these rules, but this 
is a step towards practical per-project validation rules.    </p></li></ul></li><li><p>Changes in the profile editor have been made.  </p><ul><li><p>A  simplification has been made in the logic for detecting a
concrete class. This affects XML schema generation.  </p></li><li><p>Note that ''concrete'' classes are rendered in XML Schema 
as top level elements while other classes become complexTypes. 
A class is concrete if it is not ''nested'' in another class 
anywhere in the profile except with the ''by reference'' flag.</p></li><li><p>This change has the potential to change the XML Schema generated
from existing profiles where a class was used both by reference and
not in the same profile.  That is an unlikely scenario.</p></li><li><p>The icon for a ''by reference'' association has been changed to an arrow.
The icon for a ''nested'' association is a class box.</p></li><li><p>The ''Reorganize Profile'' function (found on the Summary tab)
now has an option to convert all associations to ''by reference''.
This is mainly useful for CIM/XML profiles where that as the
correct way to model associations.</p></li><li><p>The ''Remap Profile'' has been temporarily withdrawn.  A more 
reliable way to adjust a profile when the information model
namespace(s) change is being developed.</p></li></ul></li></ul></div>
