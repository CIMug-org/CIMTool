          <h1>OWL as a Profile Language</h1>
        </div>
        <div id="main">
          <div id="content"><p>A description of CIMTool's representation of a profile in OWL.</p><h2>What is a Profile</h2><p>A profile is, roughly, a set of restrictions on a schema.  In this discussion the schema is the IEC Common Information Model (CIM) with possible extensions.  A profile is a restriction on this, intended for some application such as the Common Power System Model (CPSM).</p><h2>Definitions</h2><p>Formally, a <em>schema</em> is a set of constraints governing a set of relations. See: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics" class="external">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relation_(mathematics</a>) for a definition of <em>relation</em>.</p><p>A  <em>profile</em> of a schema is a set of constraints on the schema relations that includes the schema constraints and additional constraints.  </p><p>A <em>model</em> is a specific set of relations (ie data) that conforms to a schema or profile.  </p><p>Under the foregoing definitions, if a model conforms to a profile it follows that it conforms to the associated schema. </p><h2>The CIM in UML</h2><p>The principal language used to express the CIM is the UML class diagram.  The class diagram is interpreted as as follows:</p><ul><li>A class introduces a unary relation over individuals.</li><li>An association introduces a binary relation over pairs of individuals.</li><li>An attribute introduces a binary relation of pairs of individuals and values.</li><li>A datatype introduces a, possibly infinite, set of values.</li></ul><p>The schema constraints are then derived from the sub/super class definitions, cardinality  definitions, and type and role definitions.</p><p>Note that we don't encounter ternary or higher order relations in this interpretation.   By convention, no ternary associations are defined in the CIM.  Similarly, the <em>n</em> attributes of a class are not interpreted as a <em>n</em>-ary relation because, in general, attributes are optional.</p><h2>Profiles in OWL</h2><p>The principal language to express CIM profiles is Web Ontology Language (OWL).   </p><p>This is a pragmatic choice.  OWL is a standard language that can directly express a variety of constraints on unary and binary relations. </p><p>In OWL, unary and binary relations are called classes and properties respectively and that terminology will be used in the remainder. </p><h2>Steps In Profile Construction</h2><p>All terms in OWL are designated by Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI's).  The first step in applying OWL is to give each relation in the CIM its own URI.   </p><p>By convention, these URI's are constructed from a version-dependent CIM namespace URI and the simple names of the respective UML classes, attributes and association roles.</p><p>The second step is to write the schema constraints as OWL axioms (or definitions).  OWL provides suitable language for each type of constraint found in the CIM schema.</p><p>The third step is to add OWL definitions specific to the profile.  </p><p>Generally these are separated from the schema definitions, since there will be more than one profile for a schema.  However, the complete profile is formed from the combination of profile-specific and schema definitions.</p><h2>Profile Structure</h2><p>In principle, any OWL definitions could form a profile provided they narrow the schema.  Roughly, this means profile classes and properties must be subclasses and sub-properties of schema classes and properties.</p><p>Pragmatically, we limit the profile to a specific structure. It consists of class definitions but no additional  properties, such that: </p><ul><li>Each profile class is explicitly or implicitly a subclass of a schema class. More than one profile class may subclass the same schema class.</li><li>The profile classes are connected to each other by OWL <code>subClassOf</code>, <code>allValuesFrom</code> and <code>unionOf</code> definitions to form a structure shown in the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/au.com.langdale.cimtoole.help/html/Profile_Structure_Diagram.html" class="internal">Profile Structure Diagram</a> and in the following outline:</li></ul><ul><li><code>Global enumerated classes </code><br gap="big" /><ul><li><code>list of individuals</code><br gap="big" /></li></ul></li><li><code>Global structured classes. Subclass of:</code><br gap="big" /><ul><li><code>parent schema class</code><br gap="big" /></li><li><code>optional parent global structured class</code><br gap="big" /></li><li><code>Restrictions on property cardinality</code><br gap="big" /></li><li><code>Restrictions on property values</code><br gap="big" /><ul><li><code>Range class, either:</code><br gap="big" /><ul><li><code>Unrestricted class, or</code><br gap="big" /></li><li><code>Datatype, or</code><br gap="big" /></li><li><code>Union class of</code><br gap="big" /><ul><li><code>Global enumerated classes (by reference)</code><br gap="big" /></li><li><code>Local enumerated classes</code><br gap="big" /><ul><li><code>list of individuals</code><br gap="big" /></li></ul></li><li><code>Global structured classes (by reference)</code><br gap="big" /></li><li><code>Local structured classes</code><br gap="big" /><ul><li>has <code>same form as global structured class</code></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Profile Classes</h2><p>Each profile class is both an RDFS <code>Class</code> and either an RDFS <code>Datatype</code> or an OWL <code>Class</code>. However each has a specific form of definition.</p><h3>Global Classes</h3><p>The <em>global classes</em> are the principal classes of the profile. Each global class is named by URI in the profile namespace and may be referenced elsewhere in the profile or in a model.  </p><p>A global class is either:</p><ul><li>an <em>enumerated class</em> or </li><li>a <em>structured class</em></li></ul><h3>Structured Classes</h3><p>A <em>structured class</em> is composed using OWL <code>subClassOf</code> from exactly one schema class, optionally one (other) global class, and a number of restrictions.  The profile class is effectively the intersection of the schema class and the directly or indirectly inherited restrictions.</p><h3>Enumerated Classes</h3><p>An <em>enumerated class</em> is constructed by listing its instances using an OWL <code>oneOf</code> definition.</p><h3>Restrictions</h3><p>A <em>restriction</em> is an anonymous class for which some rule regarding a schema property holds.  The restriction is implicitly a subclass of the the property domain, which by convention is always a specific class in the schema.</p><ul><li>A restriction using OWL  <code>cardinality</code>, <code>maxCardinality</code> or <code>minCardinality</code> limits the number of values that the property can take.</li><li>A restriction using OWL <code>allValuesFrom</code> specifies a range class to which the property values must belong.</li></ul><h3>Range Classes</h3><p>A <em>range class</em> is an anonymous class introduced by each <code>allValuesFrom</code> restriction to define the type of a property.  The range class implicitly inherits the range of the property declared in the schema.  It will take one of three forms:</p><ul><li>A <em>datatype</em>, if the restricted property is defined as <code>DatatypeProperty</code> in the schema,</li><li>A <em>union class</em>, or</li><li>An <em>unrestricted class</em></li></ul><h3>Union Classes</h3><p>A <em>union class</em> is an anonymous class composed using OWL <code>unionOf</code> from one or more:</p><ul><li>global classes and/or</li><li>l<em>ocal classes</em></li></ul><p>As the union is used to define the range of a property in a particular context, its constituent classes should be subclasses of the property's range defined in the schema.</p><h3>Local Classes</h3><p>A <em>local class</em> is an anonymous class defining (part of) the range of a property.  It may be an enumerated class or a structured class.  (That is, a local class definition has the same form as a global class definition.)</p><h3>Unrestricted Classes</h3><p>An <em>unrestricted class</em> is an anonymous class with no further definition, other than annotations.  The interpretation of an unrestricted class depends on whether open or closed world semantics are applied.  (See below.)  </p><h3>Datatypes</h3><p>A <em>datatype</em> is designated with RDFS <code>Datatype</code> and no further definition is provided within the profile.  (This is an area for further development.) The schema defines the range of the associated <code>DatatypeProperty</code> using an XML Schema Part II Datatype. </p><h3>Concrete Classes</h3><p>A structured class may also be <em>concrete.</em> Concrete classes are identified by the annotation: <code>hasStereotype concrete</code>. The interpretation of a concrete class depends on whether open or closed world semantics are applied. (See below.)</p><p>Normally, any structured class that has no subclasses would be marked concrete.</p><h2>Open and Closed World Interpretations</h2><p>A profile may be interpreted with either open, semi-open or closed world semantics depending on the application.   </p><h3>Closed World Interpretation</h3><p>In a closed world interpretation, each individual must be a member of a concrete class defined in the profile and each property instance must conform to a restriction defined in the profile.  Other classes and properties must not appear in the model, whether or not they appear in the schema.  </p><p>As a particular case, where an unrestricted class appears in the profile, the model may contain a reference to an individual but must not contain properties of that individual.</p><p>Note that this interpretation is intended for applications where the profile will be translated to artifacts such as XML schema, SQL DDL, or java interfaces.</p><h3>Semi-open World Interpretation</h3><p>In a semi-open world interpretation, each individual in a model must be implicitly or explicitly a member of at least one concrete class defined in the profile.  </p><p>However, any property instance may appear in a model, whether or not the property appears in the profile or schema, provided the profile and schema constraints hold.</p><p>This interpretation is intended for certain RDF applications.</p><h3>Open World Interpretation</h3><p>In an open world interpretation, any class or property instances may appear in a model , provided the profile and schema constraints hold. </p><h2>Profile Annotations</h2><p>Any class in the profile except a restriction may carry annotations. The possible annotations are:</p><h3>Labels</h3><p>A label is defined with RDFS <code>label</code> annotation.  It represents the conventional name for the class, which may have an unrelated URI or no URI.   </p><p>The label is typically copied from the parent schema class or, in the case of a range class, from the schema property.  However, it is permitted for a profile class to have a label different from its parent in the schema.</p><p>Labels may be used to identify profile classes in displays and should be used as the names of elements in artifacts generated from the profile.   </p><h3>Comments</h3><p>A comment is defined with RDFS <code>comment</code> annotation.  A comment may describe:</p><ul><li>the role of the class in the specific application concerned  </li><li>additional restrictions on the class that cannot be expressed in OWL</li></ul><p>A comment in the profile need not duplicate the original comment on the parent schema class or property.</p><h3>Localisation</h3><p>Labels and comments may carry a language tag that allows alternative translations to appear in the profile.  </p><h3>Stereotypes</h3><p>A stereotype is defined with a UML <code>hasStereotype</code> annotation.  Stereotypes are intended as an extensible mechanism for influencing the form or semantics artifacts generated from the profile. The interpretation of stereotypes other <em>concrete</em> is not standardised. </p></div>
