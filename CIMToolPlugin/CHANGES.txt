  * CIM/XML validator passes the full test suite, available at 
    http://files.cimtool.org/Validation-Cases-2008-02-15.zip
    
  * Includes incremental CIM/XML validation.  
    
  * User interface improvements.

== Changes 2008-01-31 ==

  * CIMTool has expanded namespace support described here:
    http://cimtool.org/cimtool/wiki/CIMToolNamespaceSupport
    
    * There is support for multiple extension model namespaces.
     
    * Optionally, those namespaces can be carried through to 
      profile artifacts (legacy-rdfs and simple-owl).  This corresponds
      to the current practice on the ERCOT project. 
      
    * The pros and cons of the latter practice are discussed here: 
      http://cimtool.org/cimtool/wiki/Namespaces
      
    * For a discussion of CIM extension model techniques using CIMTool
      see the UISOL Distributech presentation.
     
  * The CIM/XML validation function has been further developed.
    
    * Basic topology validation tests are now included
      and the profile conformance tests have been expanded.  
    
    * Memory footprint is down and speed is up.  
      It is now possible to validate giant models such 
      ERCOT in about the same time again it takes to parse their XML. 
      That is about 5 minutes parse plus 5 minutes validation on my box. 
      The models used for IOP testing only take seconds.        

    * A simplified user interface for validating models has been
      added.  It is implemented as an eclipse 'perspective' with 
      fixed layout and new views, actions and wizards for streamlining 
      this task. 
	  From the menu select Window > Show Perspective > Validation.
	  
    * A validation result browser has been implemented. This groups
      messages by class and property and is linked to the Project Model
      View.
      
    * Repetitive validation messages involving with the same description
      and the same class or property are now suppressed by
      default.  This behaviour is controlled by a preference.
      Check Window > Preferences > CIMTool > Limit validation output.
      
    * The validation rule language has been improved and simplified.
      It is still rather technical to write these rules, but this 
      is a step towards practical per-project validation rules.    

  * Changes in the profile editor have been made.  
    
    * A  simplification has been made in the logic for detecting a
      concrete class. This affects XML schema generation.  
      Note that ''concrete'' classes are rendered in XML Schema 
      as top level elements while other classes become complexTypes. 
      
      A class is concrete if it is not ''nested'' in another class 
      anywhere in the profile except with the ''by reference'' flag.
      
      This change has the potential to change the XML Schema generated
      from existing profiles where a class was used both by reference and
      not in the same profile.  That is an unlikely scenario.
            
    * The icon for a ''by reference'' association has been changed to an arrow.
      The icon for a ''nested'' association is a class box.
      
    * The ''Reorganize Profile'' function (found on the Summary tab)
      now has an option to convert all associations to ''by reference''.
      This is mainly useful for CIM/XML profiles where that as the
      correct way to model associations.
      
    * The ''Remap Profile'' has been temporarily withdrawn.  A more 
      reliable way to adjust a profile when the information model
      namespace(s) change is being developed.
