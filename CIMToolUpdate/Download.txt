[[PageOutline]]
 
== Installation ==

There are several ways to obtain CIMTool.  
The best method depends on what you already have installed and 
whether you are behind a web proxy. 

=== A Complete Setup ===

If you don't have eclipse or java, 
or you just want a simple installation procedure, then download: 
http://files.cimtool.org/CIMTool-Eclipse-VERSION.zip 

'''Note:''' This package is for Microsoft Windows only.  
It contains eclipse 3.3 and java 6, so please consult their licenses 
which are contained in the package.

'''To install:''' simply unzip the package in a location of you choice, for example `C:\`. 
This will create a folder called `eclipse` which contains `eclipse.exe`.  
Double click `eclipse.exe` to launch.   

You can update this installation without downloading the whole thing again.   
From the eclipse menu, choose Help > Software Updates > Manage Configuration 
and scan for CIMTool updates.

=== Eclipse Update from files.cimtool.org ===

If you have eclipse 3.3 and java 5 or 6 then use the CIMTool update site:
`files.cimtool.org` 

1. Start eclipse and choose Help > Software Updates > Find and Install...

2. Select "Search for new features to install" and click Next.

3. Select "New remote site" and specify `http://files.cimtool.org`.

4. Enable the site (check its entry in the list) and disable all others.

5. Click finish and follow the installation dialogs.

If you already have CIMTool installed and just want to update to the latest version
use Help > Software Updates > Manage Configuration and scan for CIMTool updates.

=== Eclipse Update from a Downloaded Archive === 

Use this technique if you are behind an uncooperative web proxy or wish to share a single
download with several local users. It assumes you have eclipse 3.3 and java 5 or 6. 

1. Download http://files.cimtool.org/CIMToolUpdate.zip
 and place it anywhere convenient (a windows shared drive perhaps).  
 Don't unzip it.

2. Start eclipse and choose Help > Software Updates > Find and Install...

3. Select "Search for new features to install" and click Next.

4. Select "New archived site" and specify the zip file's location.

5. Enable the site (check its entry in the list) and disable all others.

6. Click finish and follow the installation dialogs.

For the next update, if you place the zip file in the same location,  you can 
use Help > Software Updates > Manage Configuration and scan for CIMTool 
updates.

== Source Code ==

The latest source code is available from the subversion repository. 
It is organised as a set of eclipse java projects. 
You can browse the source [http://cimtool.org/cimtool/browser/trunk/CIMToolEclipse here].

To obtain a working copy you must install [http://subversion.tigris.org/ subversion], 
which is available for windows, linux and as an eclipse plugin.   
The address of the repository is `svn://cimtool.org//trunk/CIMToolEclipse` and anonymous 
read access is enabled.

== Getting Started ==

Once CIMTool is installed you probably want to create a CIMTool project.   
See [wiki:GettingStarted Getting Started] or [wiki:CIMToolTasks Common CIMTool Tasks].
